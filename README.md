# Linktree-like web application

👍 This web application is my take on the social-media-click-through 
websites that's becoming quite common in affluent channels. An
example of this can be found at [linktree](https://linktr.ee/) and
flavours on almost even instagram user's bio.

### Development stages
1. Design UI/UX prototype ✅ (Completed)
2. Implement HTML and CSS ✅ (Completed)
3. Backend to enable SaaS 🎯 (In progress)

The goal for this application is to have a dynamic front page 
which can be seen by anyone that clicks through from any available
social media platforms. 

The front page would consist of buttons with its data loaded 
from a database. There will also be a private admin page with
functions to add, edit and remove buttons which would directly
affect the buttons shown at the front page.

👑 Overall this will enable the admin (for this instance, me) to
efficiently add, edit or remove buttons without the need to
hard code extra buttons in the HTML file.
